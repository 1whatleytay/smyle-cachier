[Submitted](https://devpost.com/software/smyle-dxeg09) to [Hack the North 2019](https://2019.hackthenorth.com/) ([Devpost](https://hackthenorth2019.devpost.com/submissions)).
Teammates were [LunarCoffee](https://github.com/LunarCoffee), (YashMulki)[https://github.com/YashMulki] and (YT-Main)[https://github.com/YT-Main].

I really thought we did well here!
Our main idea was to make a product that you could allow you to "pay with your smile" instead of a physical card of some kind.
We thought we could provide security and convenience to our customers.
This repository is just the server end, Yash Mulki has the mobile app source.
